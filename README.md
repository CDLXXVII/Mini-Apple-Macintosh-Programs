Hi! Here you can download programs for your Mini Apple Macintosh: actual computer thing. Currently i made one demo and one game for it. I'm no programmer so feel free to optimize and update the code if you feel like it.
These are Arduino 2.0 sketch files. You need to open them with Arduino 2.0 or higher, set it up for using with ESP32 (https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/), choose ESP32C3 Developer kit, insert your ESP32 cable, choose a valid COM Port and hit "Upload".
